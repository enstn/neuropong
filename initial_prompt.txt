# Neuropong Project Context

I'm working on a Pong game implementation that bridges Rust and Python using PyO3. The project consists of three main components:

## 1. Game Implementation (game.rs)
A Pong game implementation using the ggez game engine with the following key features:
- Screen dimensions: 800x600
- Ball with constant velocity and collision detection
- Paddle control with up/down movement
- Score tracking
- Game state synchronization with Python

## 2. Python Bindings (lib.rs)
PyO3 bindings that expose the following to Python:
- `PaddleAction` enum (Up, Down, Stay)
- `PyGameState` class (ball_x, ball_y, paddle_y, score)
- `PyPongController` class for game control

## 3. Project Structure
```
Cargo.toml dependencies:
- pyo3 = "0.19.2"
- ggez = "0.9.3"
- mint = "0.5"
- rand = "0.8.5"
```

Here's my complete source code:
