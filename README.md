This is my trials & errors on training (simulated) neurons to pingpang some pongs. Inspired by this 2022 [paper](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)00806-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627322008066%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) from [Cortical Labs](https://corticallabs.com/).
